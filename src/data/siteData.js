    longDescription: "This blog started as a simple idea: create a space where I could share my thoughts on code, philosophy, and the intersection of technology and humanity. What began as a weekend project turned into a full-fledged platform with dark mode, search functionality, interactive animations, and a design system that I'm genuinely proud of. Every feature was built with intention, from the reading progress bar to the quote highlight sharing system. It's not just a blog—it's a reflection of how I think about design, user experience, and the craft of building things on the web.",

    longDescription: "We all have that problem: you write a perfect solution to a problem, save it somewhere, and six months later you can't find it. This tool solves that. It's a simple but powerful way to organize code snippets by language, tags, and categories. You can search through them, copy with one click, and even share them with others. Built with React and local storage, it's completely client-side and private. No data leaves your browser. It's become an essential part of my workflow, and I use it daily.",

    longDescription: "Design systems are great, but maintaining design tokens can be a pain. This tool takes a base color palette and generates a complete set of design tokens—colors, spacing, typography scales, shadows, and more. You can export them as CSS variables, JSON, or even as a theme file for your favorite framework. It's helped me maintain consistency across multiple projects and has saved me countless hours of manual work. The best part? It's open source and free to use.",

This knowledge base is my attempt to centralize everything. It supports markdown, tags, backlinks, and a graph view of how ideas connect. It's not polished or production-ready, but it works for me. Sometimes the best tools are the ones you build for yourself.",

    longDescription: "I love animations. Smooth transitions, subtle hover effects, loading states—they make interfaces feel alive. But I was tired of rewriting the same animation code over and over. So I built a library of reusable CSS animations. Fade ins, slide ups, scale effects, and more. Each animation is carefully crafted to feel natural and performant. It's become my go-to resource for adding polish to projects, and I've open-sourced it so others can benefit too.",

It supports different HTTP methods, headers, authentication, and even request chaining. It's not trying to be Postman—it's trying to be the tool I actually want to use. Fast, simple, and focused on the task at hand. Built with React and a focus on developer experience.",
